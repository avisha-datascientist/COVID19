# COVID19

COVID19 dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset
This notebook is an attempt to visualize and analyze COVID19 cases in terms of deaths, recoveries and cases across the world using data from January 2020 to September 2020. I also made a comparison with the COVID-19 trend in diffrent states in China during the same time. 
I further made predictions for the cases using different models such as AR, MA, ARIMA and Facebook's Prophet.
